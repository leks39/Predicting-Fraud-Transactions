# Predicting-Fraud-Transactions
ML project designed to identify fraud detection for banks

AJOS Bank is currently experiencing an increase in the rate of fraudulent transaction reported in the past year. In 2020, the fraud rates were reported to be 0.38% with 38 cases of fraud occurring every 10,000 transactions; this is a 100% increase from the fraud rates in the previous year. The drastic increase in fraudulent transactions requires an immediate solution as the bank is under scrutiny for being above the 0.15% industry standard. To protect the bank’s reputation, maintain customer confidence and reduce financial loss from refunding costumers. YAJOS bank has contracted a group of fraud detection experts have been engaged to build a detection system that can identify and flag fraudulent transactions.
The expert group constructed four machine learning models were designed to analyze the bank’s dataset, with the best selected using the confusion matrix and cost benefit analysis as the evaluation criterion. The most significant features that predict fraud cases were also identified, along with recommendations centered around these factors.
